# Training the Model
**NOTE: You need a sufficient computer to run CARLA and train this model (mainly a GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM). Renting a VM is a good option.**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run one of the setup scripts aligning with your operating system.
```
bash path/to/inux_vm_setup.sh
```
OR
```
./path/to/local_setup_windows.ps1 # perform this in PowerShell
```
3. Activate the Anaconda base environment.
```
source <path to conda>/bin/activate
```
